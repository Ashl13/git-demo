My boney is over the ocean
My boney is over the sea
my boney is over the ocean
and bning back my boney to me

Yeah, bring back, ah, bring back
Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me, to me
Bring back, bring back
Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me

Last night as I lay on my pillow
Last night as I lay on my bed
Last night as I lay on my pillow
I dreamed that my Bonnie is dead

Bring back, bring back
Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me, to me!
Bring back, bring back
Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me
